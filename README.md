🚀 **Blockora** is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed for **scalability**, **security**, and **community-driven growth**.  
Unlike traditional blockchains, Blockora introduces a **Proof of Contribution (PoC)** consensus mechanism that rewards participants fairly based on their real value to the network.
